    "You feel the ground rumble again as the distress signal leads you to a large network of subterranean tunnels. You don't have time to search them all, but you don't need to: your pack contains a set of deployable _sensors_ that you imagine were originally built to locate lost Elves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sensors aren't very powerful, but that's okay; your handheld device indicates that you're close enough to the source of the distress signal to use them. You pull the emergency sensor system out of your pack, hit the big button on top, and the sensors zoom off down the tunnels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a sensor finds a spot it thinks will give it a good reading, it attaches itself to a hard surface and begins monitoring for the nearest signal source _beacon_. Sensors and beacons always exist at integer coordinates. Each sensor knows its own position and can _determine the position of a beacon precisely_; however, sensors can only lock on to the one beacon _closest to the sensor_ as measured by the [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry). (There is never a tie where two beacons are the same distance to a sensor.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't take long for the sensors to report back their positions and closest beacons (your puzzle input). For example:\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">The answer must be bounded on 4 sides by zones so it must be a place where the zone edges intersect. With this version of the code I find the lines that run just outside the four edges of each zone and taking the zones in pairs find where those lines intersect (if anywhere). Note that because of the integer coordinates some intersections actually result in a pair of candidate points. Then I just checked each of the 285 intersections to find which one is outside all zones.</div>"
