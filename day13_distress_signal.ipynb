    "You climb the hill and again try contacting the Elves. However, you instead receive a signal you weren't expecting: a _distress signal_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your handheld device must still not be working properly; the packets from the distress signal got decoded _out of order_. You'll need to re-order the list of received packets (your puzzle input) to decode the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your list consists of pairs of packets; pairs are separated by a blank line. You need to identify _how many pairs of packets are in the right order_.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [1,1,3,1,1]\n",
    "    [1,1,5,1,1]\n",
    "    \n",

    "    [[8,7,6]]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    [[4,4],4,4]\n",

    "<span title=\"The snailfish called. They want their distress signal back.\">Packet data consists of lists and integers.</span> Each list starts with `[`, ends with `]`, and contains zero or more comma-separated values (either integers or other lists). Each packet is always a list and appears on its own line.\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing two values, the first value is called _left_ and the second value is called _right_. Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   If _both values are integers_, the _lower integer_ should come first. If the left integer is lower than the right integer, the inputs are in the right order. If the left integer is higher than the right integer, the inputs are not in the right order. Otherwise, the inputs are the same integer; continue checking the next part of the input.\n",
    "*   If _both values are lists_, compare the first value of each list, then the second value, and so on. If the left list runs out of items first, the inputs are in the right order. If the right list runs out of items first, the inputs are not in the right order. If the lists are the same length and no comparison makes a decision about the order, continue checking the next part of the input.\n",
    "*   If _exactly one value is an integer_, convert the integer to a list which contains that integer as its only value, then retry the comparison. For example, if comparing `[0,0,0]` and `2`, convert the right value to `[2]` (a list containing `2`); the result is then found by instead comparing `[0,0,0]` and `[2]`.\n",
