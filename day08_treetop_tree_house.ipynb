    "\n",
    "The expedition comes across a peculiar patch of tall trees all planted carefully in a grid. The Elves explain that a previous expedition planted these trees as a reforestation effort. Now, they're curious if this would be a good location for a [tree house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_house).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, determine whether there is enough tree cover here to keep a tree house _hidden_. To do this, you need to count the number of trees that are _visible from outside the grid_ when looking directly along a row or column.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Elves have already launched a [quadcopter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadcopter) to generate a map with the height of each tree (<span title=\"The Elves have already launched a quadcopter (your puzzle input).\">your puzzle input</span>). For example:\n",

    "    35390\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Each tree is represented as a single digit whose value is its height, where `0` is the shortest and `9` is the tallest.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tree is _visible_ if all of the other trees between it and an edge of the grid are _shorter_ than it. Only consider trees in the same row or column; that is, only look up, down, left, or right from any given tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the trees around the edge of the grid are _visible_ - since they are already on the edge, there are no trees to block the view. In this example, that only leaves the _interior nine trees_ to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The top-left `5` is _visible_ from the left and top. (It isn't visible from the right or bottom since other trees of height `5` are in the way.)\n",
    "*   The top-middle `5` is _visible_ from the top and right.\n",
    "*   The top-right `1` is not visible from any direction; for it to be visible, there would need to only be trees of height _0_ between it and an edge.\n",
    "*   The left-middle `5` is _visible_, but only from the right.\n",
    "*   The center `3` is not visible from any direction; for it to be visible, there would need to be only trees of at most height `2` between it and an edge.\n",
    "*   The right-middle `3` is _visible_ from the right.\n",
    "*   In the bottom row, the middle `5` is _visible_, but the `3` and `4` are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "With 16 trees visible on the edge and another 5 visible in the interior, a total of _`21`_ trees are visible in this arrangement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider your map; _how many trees are visible from outside the grid?_\n"

Interestingly I thought of two approaches to part 1 and picked the wrong one. If I'd gone with a more brute-force solution (for each tree, is it visible?) it would have looked very similar to my part 2 solution but instead I went for \"go round the edge and mark every tree you can see as visible\".</div>"
